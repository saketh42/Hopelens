# 🧠 Hopelens API (FastAPI)

This FastAPI app wraps around a trained machine learning model to predict the **percentage risk of suicide** based on input features. It's intended for educational or prototype use only.

## 🚀 API Endpoints

### ✅ `GET /`

Check if the server is running.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "FastAPI is running!"
}
```

---

### 🔮 `POST /predict`

Predicts the suicide risk percentage using a trained ML model.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "features": [35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "risk_percent": 73.25,
  "message": "High risk. Please seek support from a mental health professional as soon as possible."
}
```

## 🌟 Risk Interpretation

| Risk % Range | Message                          |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| 0–30%        | Low risk. Continue healthy habits and stay connected with others.        |
| 31–60%       | Moderate risk. Consider talking to a counselor or someone you trust. |
| 61–100%       | High risk. Please seek support from a mental health professional as soon as possible.    |

## 🛠️ Running the App

### 📅 Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn joblib scikit-learn
```

### ▶️ Run the FastAPI server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 5000
```

---

## 🥚 Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"features": [35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1]}'
```

---

## ⚙️ Customizing Logic

Modify `main.py` to adjust thresholds or messages in the `/predict` route:

```python
if risk <= 30:
    message = "Low risk. Continue healthy habits and stay connected with others."
elif risk <= 60:
    message = "Moderate risk. Consider talking to a counselor or someone you trust."
else:
    message = "High risk. Please seek support from a mental health professional as soon as possible."

```
